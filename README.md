# Rust-Guessing-Game
A simple number guessing game made using Rust that takes an input from the user and compares it to a random generated number.
The random number goes from 1 to 100.
Everytime you miss the game will tell you if your guess is bigger or smaller than the correct number.
The game will loop until the user inputs a correct guess.
